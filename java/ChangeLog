Keyzcar Java release 0.71c
==========================

2012-04-05  Shawn Willden  <swillden@google.com>

	* Refactored of Key classes to make it easier to write new
  	KeyReaders which aren't in org.keyczar.
	* Renamed Padding class as RsaPadding (should not affect client
	code since it shouldn't be used by client code).
	* Added PKCS#8 key import (including support for
	password-protected PKCS#8 keys).
	* Added workaround for IBM JCE's propensity to append an extra
	null to RSA ciphertext.
	* Added SessionCrypter to provide an API that allows easy use of a
	session key for bi-directional session-based encryption/decryption
	(thanks to jmscheiner@google.com).

Keyzcar Java release 0.71b
==========================

2011-11-02  Shawn Willden  <swillden@google.com>

	* Omit '"padding"="OAEP"' from RSA key files that use the default
	padding.  Adding the padding field breaks the current Python code.
	* Added this ChangeLog so we can more easily document what changes
	from releast to release.  Will also begin tagging each release in
	git.
